# stytch-go-magic-links

This is a lightweight [Stytch](https://stytch.com) + [Go](https://go.dev/) example app which demonstrates a quick Stytch implementation using our [Email Magic Links](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/magic-links/email-magic-links/api) product.

# Running locally

## Set up

### In the Stytch Dashboard

1. Create a [Stytch](https://stytch.com/) account. Once your account is set up a Project called "My first project" will be automatically created for you.

2. Navigate to [Redirect URLs](https://stytch.com/dashboard/redirect-urls), and add `http://localhost:3000/authenticate` as the types **Login** and **Sign-up**.

3. Finally, navigate to [API Keys](https://stytch.com/dashboard/api-keys), and copy your `project_id` and `secret`. You will need these value later on.

### On your machine

In your terminal, clone the project and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stytchauth/stytch-go-magic-links.git
cd stytch-go-magic-links
go get
```

Next, create a `.env.local` file by running the command below and replacing the keys with those copied from step 3 above.

```bash
cp .env.template .env.local
# Replace your keys in new .env.local file with the API keys from step 3 above
```

## Running locally

After completing all the set up steps above the application can be run with the command:

```go run main.go```

The application will be available at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) and you'll be able to login with Email Magic Links! 

To do so, enter your email, then check for the Stytch email and click the sign in button.

You should be signed in!

## Next steps

This example app showcases a small portion of what you can accomplish with Stytch. Here are a few ideas to explore:

1. Add additional login methods like [Passwords](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passwords/api) or [Passcodes](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passcodes/api).
2. Use [Stytch Sessions](https://stytch.com/docs/sessions) to secure your backend.
3. Secure your app further by building MFA authentication using methods like [WebAuthn](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/webauthn/api).
